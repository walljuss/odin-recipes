    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul id="ingredients">
      <li>Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Ground beef</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>Tomato sauce</li>
      <li>Cheese</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Onion</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol id="steps">
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a covered saucepan. 
        Reduce heat to low and simmer until rice is tender, 
        about 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. 
        Add ground beef and cook until evenly browned 
        and crumbly, 7 to 9 minutes.</li>
      <li>Hollow out bell peppers by removing and discarding 
        the tops, seeds, and membranes. Slice the bottoms
        of the peppers if necessary to make sure they 
        stand up straight.</li>
      <li>Arrange peppers in a baking dish with the hollowed sides facing upward.</li>
      <li>Prepare filling by mixing cooked beef, cooked rice, 
        1/2 of the tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic 
        powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. 
        Spoon an equal amount of filling into each hollowed 
        pepper.</li>
      <li>Mix remaining tomato sauce and Italian seasoning in a bowl, and pour over the stuffed peppers.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven, basting with sauce every 15 minutes, until peppers are tender, about 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>
